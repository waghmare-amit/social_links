## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In the process, I came across few problems. I didn't knew the usecases of all the function, even now I don't know, but some of the usecases are clear to me now. For ex: display types - 'flex' is used for the content to be in columns. Also I learned about the padding and margin difference, padding is used for manipulation inside the container while margin is used for manipulation outside the container. Also the CSS root property is something that makes the whole page's property set.
